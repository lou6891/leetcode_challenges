'''
There are n flights that are labeled from 1 to n.

You are given an array of flight bookings bookings, where bookings[i] = [firsti, lasti, seatsi] represents a booking for flights firsti through lasti (inclusive) with seatsi seats reserved for each flight in the range.

Return an array answer of length n, where answer[i] is the total number of seats reserved for flight i.

 

Example 1:

Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
Explanation:
Flight labels:        1   2   3   4   5
Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
Booking 2 reserved:      20  20
Booking 3 reserved:      25  25  25  25
Total seats:         10  55  45  25  25
Hence, answer = [10,55,45,25,25]
